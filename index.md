Here is **JianGuo Zhao (èµµå»ºå›½)**.

I am currently a professor at the Department of Geophysics, China University of Petroleum (Beijing). I recived my bachelorâ€™s and masterâ€™s degrees from **Jilin University** in 1998 and 2002, respectively, and a Ph.D. degree from **Tohoku University, Japan**. in 2006. I started my career at the Department of Geophysics in **China University of Petroleum, Beijing**. 

My research interests include seismic modeling, and computational electromagnetics as well.If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *jianguo.zhao@gmail.com*

## Research Interests

- Seismic wave modelling
- Seismic rock physics, reservoir prediction, and fluid identification
- Forward modeling and inversion of electromagnetic data
- Borehole electromagnetic methods
- GPR and borehole radar applications in petroleum and civil engineering
- Artificial intelligence applications in geosciences and civil engineering
- [My latest research proposal (Dec 2023)](https://caihanlin.com/file/proposal-2023.pdf)ðŸ”—111

My current research focuses on **Multi-band experimental and theoretical seismic rock physics for reservoir prediction and fluid identification**. My laboratory has developed systematic **measurement techniques to investigate the elastic properties of partially saturated rocks, from seismic frequency to ultrasonic range**. The multi-frequency measurement techniques provide great potential to clarify the features of wave dispersion and attenuation in reservoir rocks from seismic to ultrasonic frequencies, especially in the presence of fluid. Two devices involved in the direct low-frequency measurement techniques are differential acoustic resonance spectroscopy and stress-strain measurement system that are based on forced oscillation method. I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
